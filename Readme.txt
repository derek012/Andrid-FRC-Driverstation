Android DriverStation
---------------------
An open source project:

A driverstation app for Android devices that allows for the controlling of an FRC robot from your phone or tablet.

To use the app:
1. In the android wifi settings long click on your robot hotspot.

2. Click on advanced settings.

3. Enable static IP address and set to 10.xx.yy.6, where xx it the first two digits of your team number, and yy is the second two digits.

4. Set the netmask to 255.255.255.0

And thats it, you can now control your robot from the app.
